CREATING A SPECCHECKER
1. Implement your assignment in the required package. Label any methods
   and fields required by the assignment with the @Specified annotation.
   See speccheck.example.Example* for examples. See the @Specified
   annotation to see what aspects of the interface may be checked.

2. Create a speccheck.example.SpecChecker-like class for your assignment.
   Alter the main method according to the classes required by the
   assignment.
   
3. Create a speccheck.example.GenerateSpecChecker-like class for your
   assignment. Run it and paste the output into the SpecChecker-like
   class between the long lines of -. You may need to import several
   JUnit and reflection classes.
   
4. Distribute only the SpecChecker class and all classes in the SpecCheck
   package to the student. You can distribute it as a runnable JAR.
   
5. Instruct the student to import the JAR into Eclipse, add it and
   JUnit 4 to their build path, run it, and correct any non-conforming
   code.
   
A NOTE ON PACKAGES
The classes that the students write for the assignment will need to be
in a non-default package unless you move all testing code to the default
package. Classes within packages cannot reference classes in the default
package.
